Day 1
1. Refer to "Installation Instructions" from day1-data\day1_help & complete the same.

2. MUST go through "sequence.txt"  from day1-data\day1_help\ & day1-data\day1_help\slides\PPTDay1.pdf

3. Go through simple code samples from day1-data\code\src (optional : for extra practice)

4. Solve (Hands on)
4.1 Accept 2 double values from User (using Scanner). Check data type.
. If arguments are not doubles , supply suitable error message & terminate.
If numbers are double values , print its average.
Hint : Method of Scanner to use : hasNextDouble , nextDouble 

4.2 Display food menu to user. User will select items from menu along with the quantity. (eg 1. Dosa 2. Samosa 3. Idli ... 10 . Generate Bill ) Assign fixed prices to food items(hard code the prices)
When user enters 'Generate Bill' option(10) , display total bill & exit.


OR 
Create java application for the following
Accept 2 numbers from user & operation to perform
1. Add 2.Subtract 3. Multiply 4.Divide 5.Exit
Display the result of the operation. 
Java app must continue to run till user chooses exit option.

OR
Prompt user for how many numbers(double) to accept
Create suitable data structure to hold these numbers.
Prompt user to populate the values in data structure
Display the same.
Prompt user for option
1. Double nums
2. Square nums
3. Square root nums
4. Exit
As per the option , apply this operation on all nums in the data structure
display the result.

Day 2

1. Refer to today's sequence
refer : day2-data\code
to revise mem pics , GC ,packages , access specifiers n setting of classapth

(refer : whiteboard.png)

2. Solve Tank assignment along with memory picture.

What will be the output ?

class Tank {
  private int level;
  Tank(int l)
   {
     level=l;
   }
  public void setLevel(int level1)
  {
    level=level1;
  }
  public int getLevel()
  {
    return level;
  }
}	

public class Assignment {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Tank t1 = new Tank(10);
    Tank t2 = new Tank(20);
     s.o.p("1: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t1 = t2;//1st tank obj is marked GC
    s.o.p("2: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t1.setLevel(27);
     s.o.p("3: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t2.setLevel(t1.getLevel()+10);
     s.o.p("4: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
  }
}

3. What will happen (solve ready code samples : along with mem pics )
day2-data\day2_help\params_passing
3.1 TestParamPassing1.java
3.2 TestParamPassing1.java

4. Hands on

Create a  class Point2D  , under package "com.cdac.geometry" for representing a point in x-y co-ordinate system.

4.1 Create a parameterized constructor to accept x & y co-ords.

4.2 Add  show() method  --to return point's x & y co-ords

4.3 Add isEqual method to Point2D class : boolean returning method : must return true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise.

4.4 Add a method , calculateDistance , to calc distance between 2 points
Hint : use distance formula.

4.5  Create a driver  class(for UI)  , in the "tester" package "TestPoint" , with main(..)

4.6  Accept x,y co-ordinates for 2 points n store the info.
4.7  Display x,y co-ordinates of both of the points plotted  (using show() method)
4.8  Find out if the points  are same or different (Hint : isEqual)
Print the message accordingly. (print SAME or DIFFERENT)
If points are not same , display distance between these 2 points.
