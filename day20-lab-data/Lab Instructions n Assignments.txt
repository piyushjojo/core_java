     level=l;
   }
  public void setLevel(int level1)
  {
    level=level1;
  }

}

3. What will happen (solve ready code samples : along with mem pics )
day2-data\day2_help\params_passing
3.1 TestParamPassing1.java
3.2 TestParamPassing1.java

4. Hands on

Create a  class Point2D  , under package "com.cdac.geometry" for representing a point in x-y co-ordinate system.

4.1 Create a parameterized constructor to accept x & y co-ords.

4.2 Add  show() method  --to return point's x & y co-ords
eg : public String show() {.....}

4.3 Add a non static  , isEqual method to Point2D class : boolean returning method : must return true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise.
eg : public boolean isEqual(Point2d anotherPoint)
{
 return this.x == anotherPoint.x && ....;
}

eg : p1.isEqual(p2); 
OR
p2.isEqual(p1)

4.4 Add a non static method , calculateDistance , to calc distance between 2 points
Hint : use distance formula.

eg : In Tester :
double distance=p1.calculateDistance(p2);

In Point2D class
import static java.lang.Math.*;

public double calculateDistance(Point2d anotherPoint)
{
   return sqrt(pow(this.x-anotherPoint.x,2),......);
}

4.5  Create a driver  class(for UI)  , in the "tester" package "TestPoint" , with main(..)

4.6  Accept x,y co-ordinates for 2 points n store the info.
4.7  Display x,y co-ordinates of both of the points plotted  (using show() method)
4.8  Find out if the points  are same or different (Hint : isEqual)
Print the message accordingly. (print SAME or DIFFERENT)
If points are not same , display distance between these 2 points.
------------------------
Extra question1 :
1. Conside below class.
class Emp
{
  private int id;
  private String name;
  private static int noOfEmps;
}
Suppose you create , 10 emps objects, 

How many copies of
id : 10
name : 10
noOfEmps : 1

2. in Test class , in highlighted code(line no 1--6) , how many classes ? 0
how many objs ? 0
JVM is simply allocating the mem to store : 6 refs(pointers)
psvm(....) {

2. Emp e;
3. Box b;
4. Date d;
5. String s;
6. int[] data;

Can you use for-each for above requirement ?
If yes , Try it out !

4. If you have completed Point2D based day2 assignment , try this.

4.1   Create a driver  class(for UI)  , in the "tester" package "TestPoints" , with main(..)

Ask user , how many points to plot? : 100
Create suitable array.
4.2  Accept x,y co-ordinates for all the points n store it suitably. : for loop
4.3   Display x,y co-ordinates of all the points plotted so far ,using for-each loop.
4.4   Accept 2 indices from user .
Find out if the points at these indices are same or different (Hint : isEqual)
Print the message accordingly. 
If points are not same , display distance between these 2 points.
eg : In Tester 
sop("Enter 2 indices");
int index1=...
int index2=...
if (....validate indices ....)
{
   if(points[index1].isEqual(....) .....
}
else 
sop(err mesg!);

5.3 Add suitable constructors.

5.4 Override  toString correctly to return state of all fruits (return only  : name ,color , weight )

5.5 Add a taste() method : public String taste()

For Fruit : Can you identify taste of any general fruit ?
So will you add a taste() with this definition : returns "no specific taste" OR can u apply abstraction(now or may be later !)

Apple : should return  "sweet n sour"
Mango : should return  "sweet"
Orange : should return  "sour"

5.6 Add specific functionality , in the sub classes
In Mango : public void pulp() {Display name n color of the fruit + a mesg  creating  pulp!}
In Orange : public void juice() {Display name n weight of the fruit + a mesg extracting juice!}

i/p : index
Invoke correct functionality (pulp / juice / jam)

10. Exit 
--------------------
Query

Provide suitable constructor n toString


Steps
3.1  Create Customer class
3.2 Stack interface -- push & pop functionality for Customer refs. & declare STACK_SIZE as a constant. 
3.3 Create implementation class of Stack i/f -- FixedStack (array based)
3.4 Create another implementation class of Stack i/f-- GrowableStack (array based)

Once user selects either fixed or growable stack , user shouldn't be allowed to change the selection of the stack.

1 -- Choose Fixed Stack
Hint : fixed stack instance :
ctor
ref=new FixedStack();

2 -- Choose Growable Stack
Accept following options only after initial selection

3 -- Push data 
I/P : Accept customer details & store these details in the earlier chosen stack or give error mesg : NO stack chosen !!!
In case user has chosen fixed stack , n stack is full give err mesg. 
In case of growable stack , should be able to save customer details w/o getting err.

ServicePlan : SILVER,GOLD,DIAMOND,PLATINUM
Depending on the plan chosen customer can avail different types of services

Registration amounts for different plans 
SILVER :  500
GOLD : 1000
DIAMOND : 1500
PLATINUM : 2000

customer id should be system generated , using auto increment.

Unique ID(Composite Primary Key ) : email & dob(date of birth) (2 customers are SAME iff their email ids & dob is same)
3.2 

Validation Rules 
email must contain "@" & should be end with either  ".com" or ".org"  domain
password must be min 4 max 10 chars long. Must contain atleast 1 special character : # @ $ % * 
Examplle for alphanumeric strong password
"[a-z]+[A-Z]+[#@$%*\\-]+[0-9]+"

dob should be before 1st Jan 1995
duplicate customer details should not be stored.
Customer should pay  correct reg amount as per the selected plan 

Centralized exception handling is expected.

3.3 Create a simple tester , only for customer registration today.

Iff it's valid , create customer instance n display it's details
o.w display error message via custom exception

Day 10

Customer Management System , based upon collection framework

2.1 Create new project , as day11_assignment
Copy your Customer , enums , custom exceptions n validation rules n make necessary changes.

2.3 Write a tester class with the following options.

Options
1. Customer registration
i/p : all customer details (invoke validation rules n  only in case of success store customer details )
otherwise display error message

2. Customer Login
i/p : email , dob , password
Hint : indexOf(customer ref) ---> -1 =>  invalid email or DoB --> throw exc
get(index) ---> validated customer ref  => PK details are valid 
chk password ( equals of String) ---valid => success message
=>throw exc :  invalid  password !

3. Link Adhar Card
i/p email dob
In case of success , accept Adhar card details n link it.

Think : Where will you store Adhar card details ? What is the relationship between Customer n Adhar card ? : Composition , achieved via inner class
Adhar card details 
adhar card no (string) , location 

4. Change Password
i/p : email ,dob ,  old password , new password
In case of correct credentials n if Adhar card details are linked , allow user for changing password.
Steps :
authenticate customer --  failure -- exc
success --chk if customer's adhar card is linked ? --- null chking --null => not yet linked ! --exc
validate new pwd -- success --setter for pwd.

5. Unsubscribe a customer
(Remove customer details)
i/p : email ,dob
Steps : Create customer obj : wrapping PK
Use remove(Object o) : rets true => success ---Customer  un subscribed .....
o.w : throw exc 


6. Upgrade all senior citizens (users with age > 60 ) with , Diamond plan to Platinum plan 
Hint : You can hard code the date as 60 years before the current date.
(i.e Can hard code it  1st Jan 1962)
Steps :
Since search criteria : DoB n plan => non PK based ---CAN NOT use any ready func(eg : contains/indexOf...) --will have to iterate : for-each
If a match is found (based on Dob n plan) --upgrade the plan and update reg amount : to keep consistency.

I/P Book details
In case of a new book , store book details in the map.
In case of duplicate title , just update the quantity
