Depending on the plan chosen customer can avail different types of services

Registration amounts for different plans 
SILVER :  500
GOLD : 1000
DIAMOND : 1500
PLATINUM : 2000

customer id should be system generated , using auto increment.

Unique ID(Composite Primary Key ) : email & dob(date of birth) (2 customers are SAME iff their email ids & dob is same)
3.2 

Validation Rules 
email must contain "@" & should be end with either  ".com" or ".org"  domain
password must be min 4 max 10 chars long. Must contain atleast 1 special character : # @ $ % *

2.3 Write a tester class with the following options.

Options
1. Customer registration
i/p : all customer details (invoke validation rules n  only in case of success store customer details )
otherwise display error message

2. Customer Login
i/p : email , dob , password
Hint : indexOf(customer ref) ---> -1 =>  invalid email or DoB --> throw exc
get(index) ---> validated customer ref  => PK details are valid 
chk password ( equals of String) ---valid => success message
=>throw exc :  invalid  password !

3. Link Adhar Card
i/p email dob
In case of success , accept Adhar card details n link it.

Think : Where will you store Adhar card details ? What is the relationship between Customer n Adhar card ? : Composition , achieved via inner class
Adhar card details 
adhar card no (string) , location 

4. Change Password
i/p : email ,dob ,  old password , new password
In case of correct credentials n if Adhar card details are linked , allow user for changing password.
Steps :
authenticate customer --  failure -- exc
success --chk if customer's adhar card is linked ? --- null chking --null => not yet linked ! --exc
validate new pwd -- success --setter for pwd.

5. Unsubscribe a customer
(Remove customer details)
i/p : email ,dob
Steps : Create customer obj : wrapping PK
Use remove(Object o) : rets true => success ---Customer  un subscribed .....
o.w : throw exc 


6. Upgrade all senior citizens (users with age > 60 ) with , Diamond plan to Platinum plan 
Hint : You can hard code the date as 60 years before the current date.
(i.e Can hard code it  1st Jan 1962)
Steps :
Since search criteria : DoB n plan => non PK based ---CAN NOT use any ready func(eg : contains/indexOf...) --will have to iterate : for-each
If a match is found (based on Dob n plan) --upgrade the plan and update reg amount : to keep consistency.
